# Data Preprocessing 
The following preprocessing steps were undertaken to prepare the data for modeling:

#### 1  Data Cleaning: 
Handled missing values and ensured data integrity. 
#### 2 Feature Engineering: 
Created new features from existing data to better capture customer behavior. 
#### 3 Encoding Categorical Variables: 
Applied one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical format for model training. 
#### 4 Data Scaling: 
Standardized numerical features to bring them onto a similar scale, which is critical for certain algorithms.
